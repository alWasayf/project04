# Project 4

In light of recent events your company have discovered that they need to release some pressure of their employees and they needed a quick way to do so, therefore you are tasked with creating a game similar to this [design](https://www.figma.com/file/01FHtd0tROgruHCKveKOqc/Emoji-Memory?node-id=1%3A47) but better (the company's UI/UX designer was depressed and busy)

as usual the company is not in love with the design so it requires a different design of each person doing this task, however, they liked the layout, so don't change that
here are the list of requirements that came directly from the CEO:   
## Requirements
- the employee must be able to play this game on mobile and desktop (their laptops) so your game must be responsive    
- the game must be deployed    
- a backend server to presist the data is required     
- you need to use (at least) icons for matching the cards     
- you must have a card flipping animation(to make the game seem realistic)   
- to limit the waiting time, you need to use the localstorage wisely    
- you must not use the same color scheme of this design     

## Bonus

- implement levels of the game (e.g. Easy,Medium,Difficult)
- have an additional timer based mode (where you have a limited time to complete the game before you lose)
- show a preview of all the cards at the beginning of the game  
- offer a tutorial mode
